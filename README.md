# README

1. Started a new rails app , generating the controller , the model & the views. 

2. Defined the parameters for the users, the range, and the max. Created a seed file , and then migrated the database and seed file. 

3. Struggled with the rendering of multiple pages, as only the first set would populate. Added a line of code to display the page count, and the  will_paginate Gem to properly paginate the remainder of the users generated by the seed file.
